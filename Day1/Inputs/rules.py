#We should make the code readable
#The number can be placed in a variable but at the back like for eg length3 but it cant be 3length as it would give an syntax error
#We shuld not use the name of variable as the nam of the command
# As long as the spelling of both the variable used is identical then there wont be an error . I f we get name error it means that theres an spelling error
